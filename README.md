Advanced Project in Human Centered Artificial Intelligence is course at DTU.

- We have worked with data set of a company and deployed machine learning algortihms.
- Parameter tuning is applied and the models are saved.
- With the saved models, feature importances are compared especially between Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms.
